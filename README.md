## Hey, it's me, Sergiovan
 * Radical software nihilist. Rewrite everything. 
 * Chased in my nightmares by unfinished projects.
 * All language design is accidental.
 
## My site and where else to find me
https://sergiovan.me

You can tell it's mine because it links back here. Links inside, like Intel. Not mobile friendly, sorry!
## Pinned projects
[nn](https://github.com/Sergiovan/nn): My attempt at a "low level" compiled systems language. If I get it working I have more plans for this in the future...

[Sir Govan](https://github.com/Sergiovan/Sir-Govan-Discord): Discord moderation and shenanigans bot for my own little server. Some of the code is seeecret.

## FAQ
#### What kind of parser are you?
Recursive descent.

Exactly that. Down with the old, start everything again without the burden of the past.
#### Why is your website not on github?
\>.\>

It is.
#### How exhaustive is that list of places to find you?
Not very. Find me elsewheres at your own peril.
#### Why are you so obsessed with FAQs?
I just think it's funny, OK?
#### Alright fine, I'll say something that's not a question.
Thank you.
